== Summary

Description:: A footnote container. Footnotes are entered inline within the main scripture body text. The boundaries of the footnote text are defined by an opening and closing marker. Footnote-related character elements make up the footnote content.
Syntax:: `+\f_<caller>_(\fr_<C#:V#:>_)<content>\f*+`
`caller`::: Footnote caller
- `+` - The caller should be generated automatically by the translation editor, or publishing tools
- `-` - No caller should be generated or used.
- `?` - Where  `?`` represents the character to be used for the caller.
`C#:V#:`::: Chapter-verse reference. The chapter-verse separator and end-of-reference punctuation are text specific. 
`content`::: The footnote-related character elements and text which make up the footnote content.
Added:: 1.0

NOTE: See the Syntax Notes for information on the use of endmarkers for elements within footnote content.

== Discussion

- We currently allow interspersed text and foonotechars. Do we want to allow this? Or do we say that you can have one text run followed by any number of footnotechars?
- What do we want to say about WS around a footnote caller? The current model follows PTXprint in requiring a space after the caller.
